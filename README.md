# Introduction
The video assistant referee (VAR) is a football assistant referee who reviews decisions made by the head referee with the use of video footage and a headset for communication.The use of video technology has been a major talking point in 2018 Russia fifa world cup. However, the new system resulted in more discussion and controversy over officiating than would be expected as normal. Football through out the world took twitter to express their views on VAR system. Objective of this project is to do sentiment analysis on unique tweets and to find the words used in describing their emotion.

# Steps involved
1) Crawl unique tweets against hash tags
2) Preprocessing tweets
3) Feature extraction from tweet text
4) Vader Sentiment Analysis
5) Sentiment score and visualization
